Can you drive an electric vehicle across the US?

Overview

The Bipartisan Infrastructure Deal, passed in 2021, made large investments in the US's fight against climate change, commiting to 50% reduction in emissions by 2030 and 100% carbon free emissions by 2035, and a net zero economy by 2050 (White House). A major factor in this radical commitment is the transition from internal combustion engines to electric vehicles, with a 7.5 billion dollar investment in charging infrastructure. More recent legislation has published strict pollution standards for cars, helping the country to "lead the clean vehicle future" (EPA). This mandates that by 2032, ~70% of new car sales will have to be the electric vehicles. Today those sales are ~8% (USATODAY).

Despite potential benefits and high regulatory pressure to convert to electric vehicles, there are several factors getting in the way of mass EV adoption, including charging infrastructure and price. The sales of electric vehicles is not on track to meet these targets. Thus, we set out to answer the question: can you drive across the US in an electric vehicle, and what implications does that have for the broader EV industry? We will look at charger availability, vehicle specifications and sales.
